# AEEE Arduino Real-Time Robot

This page summarises a 4-week applied engineering build: from electronics validation to real-time embedded control and full system integration.

## Key Features
- Real-time timer interrupt control (deterministic control period)
- UART communication verified with oscilloscope waveforms
- Custom HMI (LCD + encoder + buttons + buzzer/LED, optional microphone trigger)
- Individual low-battery voltage indicator board
